### Portforwarding with SSH and proxychains

- Edit the `/etc/proxychains` file and comment `sock4 127.0.0.1 9050` and change sock5's port value to your desired port

- Connect with dynamic portforwarding with ssh

      ssh -l id_rsa -D {proxychains' sock5 port number}

- To scan the internal network with nmap,use

      proxychains nmap -sT 127.0.0.1

- To local port forward

      sudo ssh -l id_rsa -L {port you want to forwrd through}:127.0.0.1:{remote port discovered}  

### Removing `\r` in `exploitdb` scripts

    sed -i -e 's/\r$//' <script's name>

### Port Forwarding with chisel

- Set up a server with `chisel server -p <port> --reverse` on the attacker machine
- On the client's machine, use `./chisel client [chisel server's ip]:[chisel's server port} R:[port you want it to tunnel through on the server's machine]:127.0.0.1:[internal port running a service on the victim's machine]`

### To replace the root hash by generating a new one

- Use `openssl passwd -6 (password)`
- Clear the root hash in `/etc/shadow` and replace it with your hash, notice the highlighted part

### Installing adb-tools on Kali Linux[Ubuntu/Debian]

    sudo apt-get install android-sdk-platform-tools


### ADB-Tools

- Use `adb devices` to see devices connected
- Use `adb shell pm path <package name>` to get the apk package name
- Use `adb pull <package name>` to download apk locally

### STATIC ANALYSIS

- Use this grep examples to check for  weak cryptography e.g exposed private key

          grep -r "SecretKeySpec" *
      
          grep -rli "aes" *
      
          grep -rli "iv"

- To check for exported preferences, check the `AndroidManifest.xml` with grep

      cat AndroidManifest.xml | grep "activity" --color ##To check activities
      cat AndroidManifest.xml | grep "android:allowBackup" --color ## To check the app allows backup access
      cat AndroidManifest.xml | grep "android:debuggable" --color ### Check if the app is debuggable,it makes it easier to reverse engineer if debuggable
      cat AndroidManifest.xml | grep "android:" --color #finding android permissions

- Apps permission
  Apps can be `normal` or `dangerous`, normal perms don't pose risks or dangers if granted but `dangerous` ones pose otherwise

- Discovering Firebase Scanner

  `git clone https://github.com/shivsahni/FireBaseScanner`
  
  - Commands
