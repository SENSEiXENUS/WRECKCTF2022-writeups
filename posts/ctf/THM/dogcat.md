### LFI Bypass

- Checking through the source page, I discovered this `?view=` parameter that takes in the value `dog`. A lot can go wrong here e.g LFI,sqli e.tc. I decided
to test for LFI first, maybe the the `view` word focuses on viewing files. I tried to read the `passwd` file with absolute file `/etc/passwd` but it pops out an error.
 " only cats and dogs files".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c430eb81-09da-4c2e-b17b-6808a907d9fd)

- I focused on the idea that one of the words `dogs` and `cat` must be in the file path.Then,I tried this path

  Path-: ```dogs/../index.php```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ffbd0e3-8322-48eb-95a5-517d173d9737)

- The code adds an extension to the file path which forces our file name to be `index.php.php`. A workaround willl just be using the characters
`index` only.I got the code contents with `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=` filter to get base64 encoded contents.

### Understanding the code

- Code

       <?php
                  function containsStr($str, $substr) {
                      return strpos($str, $substr) !== false;
                  }
                  $ext = isset($_GET["ext"]) ? $_GET["ext"] : '.php';
                  if(isset($_GET['view'])) {
                      if(containsStr($_GET['view'], 'dog') || containsStr($_GET['view'], 'cat')) {
                          echo 'Here you go!';
                          include $_GET['view'] . $ext;
                      } else {
                          echo 'Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed.';
                      }
                  }
              ?>

- The code requires 2 queries `view` and `ext`.`View` receives the filepath and `ext` contains the file path.The code uses the default `.php` if
query `ext` is not added to the request. The code also checks if `dogs` or `cats` is included in the filepath before it passes to include() to include the file.
We can bypass the extension check by setting an empty `ext` query.I tested this by reading `/etc/passwd` and it worked.

 Query-:```?view=dogs/../../../../etc/passwd&ext=```

### LFI2RCE via log poisoning

-  I was able to reed apache log `/var/log/apache2/access.log`
