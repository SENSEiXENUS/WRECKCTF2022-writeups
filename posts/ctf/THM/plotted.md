- I scanned port `445` which hosts an apache http server for directories and spotted a direcotry `/management/`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3db9e70-2bc5-4283-94d6-a60272e5793b)

- The directory hosts a traffic management system.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7d5e659-8c04-49a5-bd35-12add382ef1f)

- The system is vulnerable to sql injection to bypass the admin login page and remote code execution through unrestricted file upload.I got a script to exploit it from the github [site](https://github.com/hunkaracar/Online-Traffic-Offense-Management-System-1.0---Remote-Code-Execution-RCE-Unauthenticated-).

- Shell access-:

### Privesc to user `plot_admin` with crontab

- I read the crontab file and noticed that user `plot_admin` has a crontab in `/var/www/scripts`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/433de64e-b195-4580-8e1e-11cbc8fa5e83)

- I was able to delete `backup.sh` and write a code to pop a reverse shell

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9301ec37-9428-4851-99a6-ce20a0615431)

- Reverse shell as user `plot_admin`

### Exploiting `doas` to run `openssl` and gain root

- I read `/etc/doas.conf` and discovered that I can run openssl as user `root`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0182c704-2a2f-49e2-9ae8-f52b49e92192)

- I was able  to read the `/etc/shadow` file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6b926e4-63f6-4e6f-8193-a2bc4ac11b5f)

- I escalated privilege by adding an hash to the /etc/passwd file and creating a new user

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8685edc-ccda-4259-9ea1-19f7f8507e2d)

- I wrote the file to `/etc/passwd`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c9781f0-016c-47ee-928a-3a2612ab3e0c)

- Root
