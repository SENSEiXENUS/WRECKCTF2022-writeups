- I checked the `robots.txt` file and got an hint of using `rcokyou` to bruteforce.

- I checked the index page and discovered a possible user `meliodas`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cc86528-8f25-48c7-88be-dcc70f983247)

- Then, I tried to brutforce the `ssh` service with `Hydra` which worked.

- Ssh access as user `Meliodas`

### Privesc with Python Library

- I ran `sudo -l` and discovered that user `meliodas` can execute a python script as root which is present in his directory.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e424da-f001-40bd-9015-b2ad244e9771)

- I checked the source code and noticed that the script imports 2 modules `os` and `zipfile`.We don't need to read the code further,we've gotten a sink.Python checks the current directory for
a module before it checks `/usr/lib` directory for python scripts.We can abuse one of the modules by creating a malicious script in the current working directory.A module `zipfile` will have
script `zipfile.py`.

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import zipfile
```

- I created a `zipfile.py` in the directory and added this piece of code below.

```python3
import os
os.setuid(0);os.setgid(0);os.system("bash -p")
```

- I ran the `sudoers rule ` command again to gain root

- Root!!!!
