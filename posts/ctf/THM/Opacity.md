- Ffuf's output

- In route `/cloud/`, I discovered an index page that allows user to upload images via a url.After testing this functionality, I discovered that only files with `.jpg`
can be uploaded.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc332704-ca7b-4869-8cb5-fb1893bee2ce)

- Although, gaining RCE with the `.jpg` will only be possible via LFI.I decided to exploit the fact that it checks if the url ends with `.jpg` by crafting a special url to download `shell.php` without need for `.jpg`.As seen below, I set up another fake parameter to hold the jpg extension but the shell.php file will be downloaded and the `shell.jpg` won't be downloaded.`%26` is the url-encoded string for `&`.

Url-:`http://[ip]:8000/shell.php%26file=shell.jpg`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e51dd895-7950-4451-baf8-6f3b6c8a5f28)

- Shell uploaded, I copied the shell up one directory because files in the directory gets deleted.

### USER `sysadmin`

- I discovered a keepass db belonging to user `sysadmin` in directory `/opt`.I dumped the hash with `keepass2john` and cracked with John the ripper.

- I recovered the password for user `sysadmin` in the database using keepassxc.

### PRIVESC with root php scripts

- In `sysadmin`'s home directory, I discovered the script responsible deleting the files in the route `cloud` subdirectory named `images`.The user has no write access but I noticed a library `backup.inc.php` which function `zipData` gets called.With write access,we can add a reverse shell line in php `system()` function to execute os command and spawn a root reverse shell since the process is run by root.After dropping into rabbit holes,I discovered that the user has write access to the `backup.inc.php` file.

- I added a bash reverse shell.
