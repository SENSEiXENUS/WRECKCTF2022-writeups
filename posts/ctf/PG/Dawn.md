      [~] The config file is expected to be at "/home/sensei/.rustscan.toml"
      [!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
      [!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

- We have write access to shares `ITDEPT` with no password, I was able to upload a file.

- In the `logs` directory, I discovered a `management.log` file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a57d861b-08cc-4c83-9125-879dfaa05c97)

- The `management.log` file contains processes running on the server. I noticed a process that uses `sh` to run a  file `web-control` in the
`ITDEPT` shares.

- I spawned a shell by adding a bash reverse shell code to a malicious script I named `web-control`

- I uploaded the file
