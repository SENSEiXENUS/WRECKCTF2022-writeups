- I tried to access the `robots.txt` but I met a forbidden error that only search engines can access it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba8437b7-cafc-4182-8bc5-84aebf650f8d)

- I bypassed it by setting the `User-Agent` header to `Google` with curl.

      ‚ùØ curl http://192.168.230.14/robots.txt -H "User-Agent: Google"
      User-agent: *
      Disallow: /secret_information/

- The index_page in the secret directory is vulnerable to LFI, I was able to read `/etc/passwd`.

- Instead of the normal LFI2RCE method of poisoning logs, I gained rce with the aid of the idea from this [blog](https://medium.com/@sundaeGAN/php-wrapper-and-lfi2rce-81c536ef7a06).
It involves chaining php filters to represent characters and gain remote code execution.Now, I can execute shell commands

 ### PRIVESC with PATH hijacking

 - Tom's home directory contains a binary that allows him to spawn a root shell.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8035e616-5a22-476c-a4c5-85c73f7b7322)

- The binary determines if the user is tom by executing binary `whoami`.The binary does not state the absolute path of whoami,we can hijack the path
and direct to our malicious binary.

      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <unistd.h>
      #include <stdlib.h>
      #include <string.h>
      
      int main() {
      
          printf("checking if you are tom...\n");
          FILE* f = popen("whoami", "r");
      
          char user[80];
          fgets(user, 80, f);

- To gain the root shell,we just need a  script that prints the characters `tom` because the binary compares the output of whoami to
the string `tom`.

       if (strncmp(user, "tom", 3) == 0) {
              printf("access granted.\n");
              setuid(geteuid());
              execlp("sh", "sh", (char *) 0);

- The exploitation process involves adding `/tmp` to the path variable, creating a python script that print `tom` and giving it execute permissions.
